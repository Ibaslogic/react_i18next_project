# Localization (L18n) in React with i18next (Starter Project)

Head over to your terminal and switch to the directory youâ€™d like to save your project. Then run this command to download the starter files:

```
git clone https://github.com/Ibaslogic/react_i18next_starter
```

Once your project files have been bootstrapped, open with your favorite code editor. Make sure you are inside the project directory.

Next, run `npm install` to create a `node_modules` folder for your project.

> NB: Ensure you have NodeJS installed on your computer. As a React developer, you should know this. Else, you need to [start with React](https://ibaslogic.com/react-tutorial-for-beginners/).

Now, start the dev server using `npm start`. You should see your app loaded in the browser at [localhost:3000](https://ibaslogic.com/react-tutorial-for-beginners/).
